        " haven‚Äôt seen Malayalam version of this movie so I won‚Äôt be comparing with it. This movie has amazing plot with some really outstanding twists and turns.  Ajay Devgn, well no one can beat him in this style of acting, his eyes and his body language are dialogues for him. New entrant in this sequel - Akshaye Khanna was outstanding and probably he only could have taken up this role",
        "I watched the movie in theaters two days ago. It was a great experience. A classic thriller movie that hits bang on the emotion of going to an extent to save the family. \nI watched Drishyam on my Television and I was blown away with the suspense till last scene and when I got to know that Part 2 is releasing I decided that day to watch it in theaters, just for the larger than life screen experience. ",
        "This movie is actually one of the masterpieces ever made in bollywood. As we know, the first installment of Drishyam franchise never disappoint us, with the same statement, one can also say that this movie is also a masterpiece. All the characters have played their role in a very magnificent way. There are no extra spiced things added such as entry of any superstar, item dance, songs (which really make some of the movies boring) and many more that you must find out watching the movie.",
        "Jeetu Joseph's original story of Drishyam 2 has been remade into an outstanding edge of the seat thriller, specially the 2nd half. Vijay Salgaonkar continues his mission to save his family in a story where screenplay just flows organically, the twists induces seeties & the climax just blows your mind. Tight screenplay that never ever deviates from building the climax, astute direction, crisp editing and most importantly, the original caste of Drishyam retained entirely is a master stroke. All actors deliver to the promise.",
        "Story - Movie start on the simple note with some details shared of the past,1st half of the movie runs on one track but Intermission comes on high note,but 2nd half Movie take a pace and story will keep you on edge and make you keen what will happen in the climax.Last 15 mins of the movie steel all the show and movie story ends on very high note.",
        "An excellent storyline with intense suspense after interval... The story gets it's true nature with the powerpact acting of Ajay Devgan and Akshay Khanna... The climax its just mind-blowing and no one can ever guess before the way story unfolds its secret... From the starting of the movie the background music helps you to sense the true suspense... The malaylam movie was diamond but is certainly a diamond with much more cuts and luster in it... Akshay khanna gives his powerful presence in almost every frame... The series is truly very very special for all the thriller lovers... Go and watch this must watch movie with no nonsense flawless story... Final Verdict: A Masterpiece indeed!",
        "Drishyam is the only movie that is getting better reviews this year. And it's because of the better story, direction, and acting.Abhishek Pathak as a director did a great job in giving Drishyam a conclusion. In the last part, it was missing and everyone wants to know what will happen if they found the body. This part clears everything up.All the actors gave their best and played their parts very briefly.",
        "This is what happens when novels are expressed in 2.5 hours. The efforts can be seen for creating a stylized version of post independence \"Bombay\" but that's it. There is nothing new in-terms of script and it follows all the, already exhausted genre tropes. The cast is good except for the blunder of Karan Johar. He stick out like a sore thumb among-st the impressive performance of the whole cast. The expectations from Anurag Kashyap and Ranbir Kapoor duo was not met and the result was very underwhelming. No wander people didn't watch it in theaters. I would have been very sad about my life choices after paying to watch this movie.",
        "Just go for it. First part was no doubt Great Second part is even great. Best things about these parts are it's twists and turns which will blow  your mind  totally. 1St half is decent and much needed in film to build up the story what happened after that incident to the family.2nd part as I said above ....twists ü´°ü§© .  Strong cast of 1st part remained the same that is great. In both parts everyone is great as per given roles . ",
        "No words to describe this epic movie. This is an amazing movie, Ranbir Kapoor just killed it hats off to all the cast, director, producers, writer and all the team members for making such an epic movie. But to this is the most underrated movie in Bollywood. But I must say it is an amazing, epic and great movie. This is a must watch movie in crime drama genre. I don't know why these epic movie got flop and are very underrated too.Loved this movie, Anurag Kashyap is a great director and Ranbir Kapoor is a great and authentic actor.",
        "Very unprofessional lady at counter Highly  hell out of spicy foodJust a greedy lady looked like Don‚Äôt know how to talk and behave Will never come back again",
        "I have no words to describe this movie. It's one of the best thriller/suspense movies ever made in India cinema. It is a remake of the Malayalam movie, kudos to everyone involved in the making of this film because it is really great, creates that tension & keeps you engaged througout. Amazing storytelling, powerful performances, an absolute suspense drama that lives in your mind after watching. The plot twist is so mindboggling & dare you, nothing is non-sensical. Strong plot that delivers excellence. People were clapping in the theatre! Highly recommended, do do watch it! You won't regret it!",
        "Absolutely thrilling visuals and story line!!Bollywood requires to focus on similar kind of stories where audience feel a connection, and feel moving along with the characters. Commendable direction and scriptüëèAll characters did justice to their epic role‚Ä¶though children were not seen going to schools and other places, having no connection to the outer world.",
        "An important sign of a good thriller is not building suspense but fulfilling the audience with  truth at the right time and Drishyam 2 nailed this task. Giving it the title of \"Gripping\" is undermining it's potential as you don't only gasp audibly but also never leave the edge of your seat. ",
        "The movie just blew my brains out! From the first scene, the reappearances, the brewing revenge and confusion, to the little snippets with the writer, everything fell in place and the reaction of the audience was so well deserved, seeing the hard work of the actors! I don't exactly know how to express how amazed I am, but I'd just say one, there are plot twists, and one, there is Drishyam 2!",
       "Well much awaited movie is back and i must say a good comeback. Well who can forget \"2oct ko kya hua tha \"straight away coming to the main point this sequel is yet again a worthy sequel which delivers very well though first half of the film is little stretched but i guess that is to build a story for sequel but after interval this movie is amazing keeping every viewer on the edge of seat story is perfect twist and turns are amazing. Ajay devgan again is class to watch, shriya saran is good, tabu is also good talking about the new introduction Akshay khanna is also very good and justifies to the role ",
       "This film was a disaster but it is really a fantastic crime thriller and ranbir made it realistic with his awesome acting not like salman and his rubbish movies.",
