        " haven’t seen Malayalam version of this movie so I won’t be comparing with it. This movie has amazing plot with some really outstanding twists and turns.  Ajay Devgn, well no one can beat him in this style of acting, his eyes and his body language are dialogues for him. New entrant in this sequel - Akshaye Khanna was outstanding and probably he only could have taken up this role",
